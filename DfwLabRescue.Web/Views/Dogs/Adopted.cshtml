    Rescue program. On average we have approximately 30 Labs in foster homes at any given time. Labs come into the program and are adopted daily, 
    so this is not always a complete listing. All dogs are spayed or neutered (puppies are only spayed or neutered if of appropriate age prior to adoption) 
    and tested heartworm negative unless otherwise stated. Effective April 1, 2012, Adoption fees for an adult Lab is $275 and puppies (6 months and under) 
    are $350.</strong></p>
