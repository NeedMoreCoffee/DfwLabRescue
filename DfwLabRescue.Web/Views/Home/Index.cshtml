                    DFW Lab Rescue is dedicated to alleviating the needless death and suffering of home-less or misplaced (lost and stray) purebred Labrador Retrievers in the Dallas Fort Worth area.
                    By rescuing and rehabilitating homeless Labradors in our community, vigorously promoting responsible dog ownership through active participation in pet-related events, and through our own education program, we strive for a better life for each of our animals.

                        They arrive by the dozens every day: helpless Labs, who are sick, injured or abused...puppies who are too young up for adoption, great Labs that no one had time for pets whose families are in crisis, all surrendered to shelters in the DFW Metroplex!
                        To get the second chance they deserve, these Labs desperately need foster care.
                        If you love and care about Labs and want to help them enjoy the lives they deserve, please become a DFW Lab Rescue foster-care provider today!

They are so thankful a volunteer listened to that inner voice that nudged them into signing up to do that home study, showing up to that meet n greet to talk with potential adopters or opening up their home to foster that Lab in need. Yes, each and every one of our volunteers makes a difference -- no matter what the contribution.</p>

                     She regularly set food out for him and their dog would play with him.  When they were moving she called Duck Team 6 in to capture him in the hopes of finding him his forever home and he is now with Lab Rescue.
